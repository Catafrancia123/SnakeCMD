## Common Issues
Before you create an issue, please make sure you check the following:
- Please check that the dependencies are installed.
- Did you get an error about pip not being found when you ran `pip install rich`?
  - **Windows:** That means that pip is not installed in your PATH variable. Simply run `python -m pip install rich` to go around this issue.
  - **Linux:** This means that the pip package is not installed. Run your package manager with the package `python-pip` and install `rich` after.
- Did you get an error about Python not being found when you launched `boot.py`?
  - **Windows:** Python is either not installed, or you did not check the box in the installer to put Python into PATH.
  - **Linux:** Make sure Python is installed and can be found within a folder in your $PATH variable.
- Did you run the game in Python 2 or Python 3?
  - _If you ran the game in Python 2, please run the game in Python 3._
- Did you run the game _inside_ of the extracted contents?
- Has someone already made an issue about it?
